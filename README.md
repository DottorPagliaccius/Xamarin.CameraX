# Xamarin.CameraX
Google's Android sample 'Getting Started with CameraX' ported to C# (Xamarin.Android)

Porting from https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/camerax-getting-started#0

EDIT from Google's sample: photos are saved to /Pictures/CameraX (more confortable than using ADB to see them)
